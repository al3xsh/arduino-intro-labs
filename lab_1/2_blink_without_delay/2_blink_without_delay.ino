Â * this is a simple Arduino program to blink an led (the electronics equivalent 
 * of hello world). this program turns an led on for 1 second and then off for 1 
 * second, and so on ...
 *
 * this program uses pin 13 for the led

// timing variables ...

// this method runs once (when the sketch starts)
