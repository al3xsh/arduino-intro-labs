# A gentle introduction to the Arduino platform

This repository provides some lab exercises and code for a gentle introduction to using the Arduino platform (specifically the Arduino Uno, but the exercises are generalisable to other Arduino boards). These were originally developed at Sheffield Hallam University for the BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering and BEng Computer Systems Engineering students.
